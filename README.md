## 📖 Project Description

*SnarkNav* is the ultimate anti-navigation app that roasts you every step of the way! Enter a destination, and SnarkNav will guide you there with sarcastic, Gordon Ramsay-inspired directions, poking fun at every wrong turn you make. It calculates an absurdly long, winding route, giving you humorous, step-by-step instructions. Warning: This is not your average GPS!

## 🚫 The Problem (That Doesn't Exist)

Ever feel like GPS apps are too straightforward and helpful? What if you crave a navigation experience that’s more roast than route? If your inner navigator longs for sarcasm, SnarkNav has you covered.

---

## 🧩 The Solution (That Nobody Asked For)

SnarkNav provides turn-by-turn instructions in a roasting, Gordon Ramsay-esque tone to make sure every wrong turn is met with legendary British sarcasm. With SnarkNav, you’ll never be lonely on a road trip again—even if you’re lost!
